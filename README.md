# login_template

This Flutter login template was made to be copy-pasted.

## Getting Started

Copy the code found in the authentication folder and home folder. This utilized
the built-in routing system. So make sure to check out the app.dart file.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains
